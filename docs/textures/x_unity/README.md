Photoshop Template

I hope this may be of use to those of you interested in texturing for Unity; I've tried to include as many samples and details as possible to start you off in the right direction. You can download the PSD [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d3tzqpg0ul8f9q6/unityTemplate.psd?dl=1 "Unity - PSD").


Installation
------
Click the green _Clone or download_ button on the top right and then click _Download ZIP_. Once you've finished downloading, un-zip the file to your `.minecraft/resourcepacks` folder.
