# VoxelSrv
VoxelSrv is a voxel game inspired by Minecraft, where you can build, mine and ~~craft~~ (not implemented yet).
It's still unfinished, but is somewhat playable. For now it's multiplayer-only, but thera are plans to add Singleplayer.

- [Changelog](https://github.com/VoxelSrv/voxelsrv/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

I'm open to any PR or suggestions, as long as they don't make it less playable/break more than needed.
