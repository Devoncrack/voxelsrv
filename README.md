# VoxelSrv
VoxelSrv is a voxel game inspired by Minecraft (Alpha), where you can build, mine and ~~craft~~ (not implemented yet).
I'm creating it to learn Javascript and just have some fun.
It's still unfinished, maybe someday it will be playable.

- [Changelog](https://github.com/Patbox/voxelsrv/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

Now I'm modifying it to support multiplayer and code started to look really messy. I will probably rewrite in the future.
